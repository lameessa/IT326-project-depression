## Project Title 
Analyzing Depression Survey Data: Investigating Key Factors Related to Depression
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore a publicly available dataset containing survey responses from individuals with and without depression. By analyzing factors such as income, family status, and other personal characteristics, we aim to identify potential patterns and relationships associated with depression. This project serves as a learning exercise in data mining and classification techniques, allowing us to apply what weâ€™ve learned in our coursework to a real-world dataset and gain insights into how different variables may correlate with depression.
